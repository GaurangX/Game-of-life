Game-of-life
============

My implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.
This implementation uses several nested for loops as well as two-dimensional arrays to create a grid for the cells in the simulation to interact. This excersize was done to demonstrate importance of unittests. 

To run:
python3 gol.py --universe-size 5,5 -n 3 -quality 200 -interval 200 -seed glider
