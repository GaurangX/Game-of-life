Game-of-life
============

My implementation of John Conway's Game of Life.
This implementation uses several nested for loops as well as two-dimensional arrays to create a grid for the cells in the simulation to interact. The array that is displayed to the user is 50 x 100, but actual size of the array is 52 x 102.  The reason for this is to make the calculations easier for the cells on the outermost "frame" of the grid.
